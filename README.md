# rolimonsadbot

Island-Ads is an open-source bot that will make ads (customizable by config.js) on rolimons.com. Island Ads was made for fun and personal use in Node.js. The bot doesn't require you to install or run it on your pc 24/7 as it can be easily forked onto repl. The bot allows you to somewhat consistently advertise your offer which increases the chance you get a good inbound trade or the offer you requested as more people will have the chance to view your offer.

# Config Documentaion
```
# general; general settings that are applyed to every user

# rwait_min; the minimum amount of time the bot will wait to attempt to create another add (recommended to stay at above 18minutes/1080000 milliseconds)

# archive_tm; enabling this archives all messages sent by Roblox (clearing your inbox of trading messages)

# display_on; enabling this displays all users in the config as online

# users; stores user specific settings in objects "{}" (allowing for multi-user support), to add another user copy the already provided config and paste it ahead of the already exiting config (while still in the users array "[]"). 

--> YOU WILL NEED TO EDIT THE NEW CONFIG AND ADD NEW SECRETS (with different names) FOR THE NEW USER <--

EX:
users=[
  {
    Account specifc settings
  },
  {
    Account specifc settings
  }
]

# Roli_cookie; your Rolimons cookie's variable in this format: process.env.YOUR-ROLI-COOKIES-SECRETS-NAME  (make sure these are all unique)

# rbx_cookie; your Roblox cookie's variable in this format: process.env.YOUR-ROBLOX-COOKIES-SECRETS-NAME  (make sure these are all unique)

# UserID; your Roblox user id

# item_ids; the items you want to offer in the Ad (added with the perfered item's assetid)

# r_items; the items you want to request in the Ad (added with the perfered item's assetid)

# r_tags; the rolimons tags used on the requesting side of the Ad (added as a string and all lowercase letters)

# posttop; enabling this (by setting it from false to true) will force the bot to add your top 4 items (sorted by rolimons value) to the offer side of the trade Ad

# restate; enabling this (by setting it from false to true) will restate your last outbound (in which you still have the items for) as a trade Ad (usefull for trade bots)

# webhook_url; the discord webhook's variable in this format: process.env.YOUR-DISC-WEBHOOKS-SECRETS-NAME (make sure these are all unique)

# webhook_color; the (hexcode) color of the embedded webhook url

# CAPR; Not in the config but, on the webhook so I'd like to explain it. CAPR = Completed ads per run, it shows the amount of times the bot requested to post an add, this can be reset when the repl stops or pauses due to inactivity so don't expect it to go that high.
